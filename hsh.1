.TH HSH 1 "November 2025" "Simple Shell" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
hsh - Simple command-line interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
[filename]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a simple UNIX command interpreter (shell) that reads commands from either standard input or a file, executes them, and waits for them to complete. It mimics the basic functionality of the Bourne shell (sh).

.SS Interactive Mode
In interactive mode,
.B hsh
displays the prompt "($) " and waits for the user to type a command. The command is executed, and the prompt is displayed again.

.SS Non-Interactive Mode
When
.B hsh
is run with its standard input redirected (e.g.,
.P
echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
.P
), it executes the commands from the input and exits.

.SH COMMANDS
The shell executes simple commands found in the system's PATH.
Commands are expected to be on a single line, with arguments separated by spaces.
The shell does not currently support built-in commands, pipes, or redirections.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.B hsh
returns the exit status of the last command executed.

.SH BUGS
This shell is a work in progress. It lacks many features of a full shell, including built-ins, job control, and complex syntax.
